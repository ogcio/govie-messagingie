 * Citizen-portal zones.
 *
 * The unified app serves all three from one static export. Nginx (Phase
 * D) maps each public hostname to the matching `/[locale]/...` entry,
 * but at the React layer the active zone has to be derived from the
 * current path — there is no hostname signal inside the bundle.
 *
 * Why a derived enum rather than a server constant: the alternative is
 * `process.env.zone` baked at build time (what the zones did pre-B2),
 * which breaks the moment one static export serves multiple zones.
