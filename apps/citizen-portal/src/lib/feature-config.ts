 * from one static export. A future adopter may want to deploy a reduced
 * subset (e.g. MessagingIE without Dashboard, as in the Department of
 * Education deployment) without exposing UI elements that imply the
 * presence of building blocks that are not deployed.
 *
 * These are *build-time* `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` flags (baked into the bundle),
 * not runtime Unleash toggles: deployment topology is decided at build /
 * deploy time, never per-user. Every flag defaults to `true`, so all
 * current deployments are unchanged. Runtime, user-targeted toggles
 * (e.g. `submission-linking`) live in `feature-flags-provider.tsx`.
 *
 * Profile is intentionally not flaggable — every building block requires
 * Profile, so the profile zone is always enabled.
