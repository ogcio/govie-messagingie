/**
 * Both tests sign in without filling the mock-IdP form. That is deliberate:
 * the form pre-populates a random identity on load, which is exactly the
 * brand-new, unlinked user these flows need. Filling in a seeded fixture user
 * would link an already-known account and defeat the test.
 *
 * These two tests are the only e2e that depend on a real mailbox: they send a
 * secure message to a fresh `messagingie2+<uuid>@gmail.com` alias and then
 * read it back over the Gmail API (`utils/gmail-reader.ts`). So they fail for
 * environmental reasons the portal cannot cause, and `expect(email).not
 * .toBeNull()` in the reader is where that surfaces. Before touching this
 * spec, rule those out in order:
 *   1. The Gmail OAuth refresh token in `utils/gmail-reader.ts` expires every
 *      ~30 days; once stale, `checkInbox` polls out and finds nothing. The
 *      regeneration steps are in that file.
 *   2. Dev mail delivery lag — the send can succeed while the notification
 *      lands after the poll window.
 * The send path itself (template select -> add recipient -> send) and the
 * notification subject (`secureMessageSubject`, "You have received a new
 * secure message from ...", which the reader's `subject:secure message`
 * query matches) were both verified intact for AB#42515.
