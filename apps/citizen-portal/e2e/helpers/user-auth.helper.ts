 *
 * That wait lives in here rather than in the callers, so calling this
 * straight after a `goto` cannot race the navigation: every `page.url()`
 * below is read only once `signInStepVisible` has given up waiting.
 *
 * A still-valid SSO session skips the IdP entirely. Only loginAsCitizen
 * accepts that outcome; callers that need a fresh identity get an error
 * naming the unexpected destination instead of a later locator timeout.
 *
 * The mock-IdP form itself is identical between hosted dev and local
 * (`@ogcio/logto-utils/apps/mygovid-mock-service` is the upstream for
 * both), so its locators stay unchanged either way.
